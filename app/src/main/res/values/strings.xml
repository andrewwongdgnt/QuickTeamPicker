Ever wanted to play a game with your group of friends but can never decide how to split yourselves up into teams? Quick Team Picker strives to take away that hassle by dividing your group of friends into teams for you\n\n
Now I know what you\'re thinking, &quot;I have lots of friends and I don\'t want to add all their names into the app just to play a quick game.&quot; </string>
